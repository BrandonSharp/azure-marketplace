# Getting Started

Run the following to bring down all the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

To run tests, you will also need to install [Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Build

To build the project call

```bash
npm run build
```

This will patch the templates according to the configured `build/allowedValues.json` and generate the various data node templates as well as doing several sanity checks and assertions.

The result will be a distribution zip under `dist/elasticsearch-marketplace-<date>.zip` ready to be uploaded to the publisher portal.

## Development

New features should be developed on separate branches and merged back into `master` once complete. To aid in the development process, a gulp task is configured to update all of the github template urls to point at a specific branch so that UI definition and web based deployments can be tested. To run the task

```sh
npm run links
```

will update the links to point to the name of the current branch. Once ready to merge back into `master`, a specific branch name can be passed with

```sh
npm run links -- --branch master
```

If you fork the repository, you can update the links to point to your own github repository using

```sh
npm run links -- --repo <username>/<repo> --branch <branch>
```

where

- `<username>` is your github username and `<repo>` is the name of the Azure Marketplace github repository. Defaults to the remote origin repository.
- `<branch>` is the name of the branch. Defaults to the name of the current branch 

## Testing

For this you need to create a [Create a Service Principal - Azure CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/blob/master/docs/get-started/create-service-principal.md).

Then copy the `.test.example.json` file and enter the credentials for the Service Principal into `.test.json`

```bash
cp build/.test.example.json build/.test.json
```

`.test.json` is git ignored but **always take extra care not to commit this file or make a copy of it**.

Now that the test file is set up, validation tests can be run with

```bash
npm run test
```

Which will login to the Azure account accessible by the Service Principal account and create a
resource group with the name `test-<hostname>-<scenario>-<date>` and perform online validation
of the template using the scenarios parameters.
When done, the command will clean up the resource groups and logout of azure.

Tests use the template checked into the github repository branch, so be sure to push any changes that need to be tested up to GitHub.

### Testing a specific version

By default, tests always use the last version specified in the versions array in `build/allowedValues.json`, but you can specify a version using

```bash
npm run test -- --esVersion 6.2.4
```

A random value from the versions array can also be used

```bash
npm run test -- --esVersion random
```

### Specifying tests to run

All test scenarios in `build/arm-tests` are run by default. Specific tests can be targeted with

```bash
npm run test -- --test 3d.*
```

where the `--test` parameter is a regular expression to include tests to run.

### Deploying tests

the `test` command will simply validate that the template parameters are valid, but a deployment can be performed with

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This is similar to `test` but will also deploy scenarios that have `isValid:true` configuration,
once all the scenarios have been validated.
Some post install checks are performed on the deployed cluster to assert successful deployment.

**NOTE:** Be sure that you have sufficient core quota in the subscription and location into which you're deploying.

### Keeping resource groups around after testing/deploying

Both `test` and `deploy` will attempt to clean up the resource groups created as part of a test run,
but whilst developing, this may not be desirable. You can use the `--nodestroy` parameter to
keep resource groups around after the tests have finished, whether successfully or not

```bash
npm run deploy -- --nodestroy
```

Be sure to delete resource groups after you've finished with them.

### Cleaning up resource groups

Both `test` and `deploy` will attempt to clean up the resource groups created as part of a test run, but sometimes this
may not happen e.g. testing process manually stopped part-way through. When this happens, you can run

```bash
npm run azure-cleanup
```

to remove all resource-groups starting with `test-<hostname>-*`, where `<hostname>` is the name of
your machine.

## Automated UI tests

The automated ui tests are not (yet) part of the main test command to run them:

```bash
npm run headless
```

## Benchmarking

[Rally](https://github.com/elastic/rally) can be deployed onto a separate VM in
conjunction with deploying a cluster, to allow rally benchmarking tracks to
be run against the cluster. An example deployment with PowerShell

```powershell
$location = "Australia Southeast"
# Use the benchmarking branch, which contains the template changes to
# also deploy a benchmarking VM
$templateVersion = "benchmarking"
$templateUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/azure-marketplace/$templateVersion/src"
$elasticTemplate = "$templateUrl/mainTemplate.json"
$resourceGroup = "benchmark-premium"
$name = $resourceGroup
$password = "Password1234"

$clusterParameters = @{
    "artifactsBaseUrl"= $templateUrl
    "esVersion" = "7.1.1"
    "esClusterName" = $name
    # A single attached disk per data node
    "vmDataDiskCount" = 1
    "vmDataDiskSize" = "2TiB"
    "vmDataNodeCount" = 3
    "vmSizeDataNodes" = "Standard_DS1_v2"
    "vmSizeMasterNodes" = "Standard_DS1"
    "dataNodesAreMasterEligible" = "Yes"
    "kibana" = "No"
    "storageAccountType" = "Default"
    # Deploy a benchmark VM with rally
    "benchmark" = "Yes"
    "loadBalancerType" = "external"
    "xpackPlugins" = "Yes"
    "adminUsername" = "russ"
    "authenticationType" = "password"
    "adminPassword" = $password
    "securityBootstrapPassword" = $password
    "securityAdminPassword" = $password
    "securityRemoteMonitoringPassword" = $password
    "securityApmPassword" = $password
    "securityBeatsPassword" = $password
    "securityKibanaPassword" = $password
    "securityLogstashPassword" = $password
    # disable ml, alerting and monitoring X-Pack features
    "esAdditionalYaml" = "xpack.ml.enabled: false\nxpack.monitoring.enabled: false\nxpack.watcher.enabled: false"
}

New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name $name -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup `
    -TemplateUri $elasticTemplate -TemplateParameterObject $clusterParameters
```

It's important to deploy a sufficiently powerful benchmark VM with good disk IOPS,
to ensure that rally itself is not a bottleneck in a benchmarking run. The default
SKU size for the benchmarking VM is `Standard_DS4_v2` with 16 Premium managed disks in
RAID 0.

Once the deployment has finished, ssh into the benchmark VM

```sh
ssh <admin>@<benchmark public ip>
```

configure rally for benchmarking

```sh
esrally configure
nano ~/.rally/rally.ini
```

set `root.dir` and `src.root.dir` to use the managed disks, and optionally change
`env.name` to something meaningful

```sh
[system]
env.name = premium-disks

[node]
root.dir = /datadisks/disk1/.rally/benchmarks
src.root.dir = /datadisks/disk1/.rally/benchmarks/src
```

if capturing metrics in Elasticsearch, include these details. For example,
for storing reports in [Elastic's Elasticsearch Service](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service)

```sh
[reporting]
datastore.type = elasticsearch
datastore.host = <id>.<location>.aws.found.io
datastore.port = 9243
datastore.secure = True
datastore.user = <username>
datastore.password = <password>
```

and save the configuration file.

Now to run a benchmark; In this example

1. [the `pmc` track is used](https://github.com/elastic/rally-tracks/tree/master/pmc)
which is a reasonable track for benchmarking indexing latency and throughput
2. The addresses to all data nodes are provided
3. Rally is configured to abort when there is a request error

(You may need to grant permissions to `/datadisks/disk1/` for esrally)

```sh
esrally --pipeline=benchmark-only --target-hosts=data-0:9200,data-1:9200,data-2:9200 \
        --client-options="basic_auth_user:'elastic',basic_auth_password:'Password123',timeout:300" \
        --on-error=abort --track=pmc --challenge=append-no-conflicts-index-only
```

Results can be further annotated by passing user tags on the command line. For example, `--user-tag="storage:local-ssd"`. 

Consult the [command line reference](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line_reference.html) for further details.

Once the benchmark has finished, the high level overview will be output to stdout, with more detail captured in Elasticsearch (if configured as a datastore) or in `~/.rally/benchmarks/races`.
